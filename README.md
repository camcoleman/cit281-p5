For this project, you will be creating some type of a game using a JavaScript class, a web server, a client program, and separate code modules. What game you choose to create is entirely up to you, so long as your final product meets the project requirements. You can use AI to assist with this project, and how much is up to you. The more you interact with AI to build your code, the more you'll learn. Simply asking AI to create everything will not help you learn. Some aspects of the final project will most likely be mostly AI-generated, such as the client components, as this class does not focus on client-side development.
